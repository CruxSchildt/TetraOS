# TetraOS

TetraOS is an open-source operating system running on the Linux kernel. TetraOS is meant to be a stable and user-friendly Linux distribution for Linux beginners. Your experience with TetraOS is meant to be customizable, fluid, and secure. 

This project aims to implement TetraOS first as a `Linux Desktop Environment (DE)`, with its Display Server, System UI, and applications. The current plans are to base TetraOS on Arch Linux. Moving on, the ambition would be to then package this DE and include it with an Arch ISO to make a full standalone Linux distribution.
